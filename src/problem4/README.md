# Sum to N - Efficiency and Complexity

## Methods Implemented

1. **Iterative Loop**
2. **Recursive Function**
3. **Mathematical Formula**

## 1. Iterative Loop

### Complexity

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)

### Efficiency

This is a classic approach and works well for all practical values of n. It is memory efficiency, but becomes slower as n increases due to the linear loop.

## 2. Recursive Function

### Complexity

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n)

### Efficiency

Elegant, but not suitable for large n as it may cause a stack overflow due to deep recursion. Use only for small values of n.

## 3. Mathematical Formula

### Complexity

- Time: O(1)
- Space: O(1)

### Efficiency

This is the most efficient method. It runs in constant time and requires no iteration or recursion. Ideal for performance-critical applications.
